Project Title: IELTS Speaking Test ‚Äì Backend Enhancement
Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to improve the backend functionality of the IELTS Speaking Test platform by implementing request validation, structured logging, and error handling. These features ensure that the backend is secure, robust, and easy to maintain in production environments.

Key Features:
‚úÖ Request Validation Middleware
Validates incoming API requests to ensure all required fields (like name and answer) are present and correctly formatted.

Prevents invalid or incomplete data from being processed.

Sends clear error messages when fields are missing.

üìã Structured Logging
Implements detailed logging using Python‚Äôs logging module.

Captures useful metadata such as:

Timestamps

Request paths

Status codes

Error messages

Logs are stored in a dedicated file (app.log) for debugging and monitoring.

‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling Middleware
Custom handlers are created for common HTTP errors like:

400 (Bad Request)

404 (Not Found)

500 (Internal Server Error)

All unexpected errors are caught and logged.

User-friendly error messages are returned to the client.

Testing and Validation:
Tested using tools like Postman to simulate both valid and invalid API requests.

Ensured that:

Valid requests return success messages.

Missing fields result in clear, descriptive error responses.

Malformed JSON is properly caught and handled.

Verified that all API activity and errors are recorded in log files.

Outcome:
This backend enhancement improves the reliability and maintainability of the IELTS Speaking Test platform by:

Preventing bad data from entering the system.

Providing meaningful feedback to users.

Giving developers clear insights into API activity and issues through logs.
